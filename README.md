## React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

This application was started with Vite, following the Tailwind CSS [instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite), and selecting the React framework with Javascript + SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) variant.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
